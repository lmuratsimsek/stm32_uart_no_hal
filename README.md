  * @brief  System Clock Configuration
  *         The system Clock is configured as follow :
  *            System Clock source            = PLL HSE
	*            HSE Frequency(Hz)              = 8000000
  *            SYSCLK(Hz)                     = 16800000
  *            HCLK(Hz)                       = 8000000
  *            AHB Prescaler                  = 1
  *            APB1 Prescaler                 = 4
  *            APB2 Prescaler                 = 2
  *            PLL_M                          = 4
  *            PLL_N                          = 168
